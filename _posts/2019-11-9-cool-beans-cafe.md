This past week was dedicated to building my own project: a website for a fictional coffee shop called, "Cool Beans Cafe." I'm almost finished and it incorporates many of the elements that I have learned so far, all of which have responsive breaking points for mobile, tablet, and desktop. These features include a top navbar which collapses into a navbar-toggler button, several images which stack when scaled down, and a media query - some text that adjusts to size as well.

I also included a background image - a picture of a coffee shop counter - which stays fixed when scrolling the rest of the content. I darkened this image so that it wouldn't compete with the rest of the page and make it appear too "busy". This was something that the course didn't teach, and although it was pretty simple to stitch together, I'm pretty proud of the result.

This was a fun project to make, as I've been itching to do something completely on my own. I'm sure I'll look back on it later as pretty simple, but oh well. I'll be posting it to my Github later.
