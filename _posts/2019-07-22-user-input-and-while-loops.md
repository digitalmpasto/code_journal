title: "Python Crash Course - Chapter 7 - User Input and While Loops"
categories: misc
---

I've been coding the last few days but for some reason have forgotten to add my progress to my code journal. Lately I've been learning about the input function and while loops. So it has been getting a bit more interesting lately. Today I learned how to move items in a list to another list and how to fill a dictionary with user input. Also, I'm starting my third, and final class for my data science certificate.
