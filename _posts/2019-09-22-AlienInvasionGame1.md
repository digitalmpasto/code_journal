Well I began following along with the book creating this Alien Invasion Game. There wasn't much left of the syntax portion of the book so I skipped ahead. Anyway, in the midst of everything I got confused about what was happening and decided to go back into the Classes chapter and read over what I learned. Now I have even more questions. Hopefully I can get some things resolved. I put in quite a bit of time on it this weekend and feel lost, which is discouraging. Patience is key.
