Haven't posted in awhile, but I have been studying. I'm almost finished with the chapter on classes but have been going back through the chapter to try and get a better understanding. One more chapter after all (on files and exceptions) and then I'll be done with the syntax portion of the book. Then onto a project. Slowly but surely.
