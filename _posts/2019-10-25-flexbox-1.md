This lesson focused on the Flexbox utilities that BS4 comes with. Flexbox is a model for positioning content inside of a box. It exists on its own, independent from Bootstrap, however, Bootstrap embeds Flexbox, allowing for easy use of its utilities. I suppose one of the most important things to take from the lesson, is knowing that the "main axis", is by default, from left to right. This means that the start of a flexbox is on the left side. The end is on the right. The "cross axis" default is from top to bottom. Flexbox makes it really easy to move elements, such as boxes for example, within a box. 

The default value for an element or set of elements will be <...justify-content-start...>. This doesn't need to be specified. It's good to know however, because you can change it to <...justify-content-end...>, for example, and have your content moved to the right side. Likewise, you can use <...justify-content-center...>, <...justify-content-between...> (creaitng space between elements), or <...justify-content-around...> (much like 'between' but will create space 'around' the entire element(s)).
