Learned about the new display unit in Bootstrap 4. You can do some pretty neat stuff here. You can change a display from a block to an inline element with 'd-line', or vice vers with 'd-block.' You can also hide displays. For example with <h1 class="d-xl-none">Hide me on xl</h1>, you can hide the text when expanding the surface to a large size. You can compound upon this by doing things like <h1 class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-none">Always hidden except lg</h1>. Pretty cool.
