I attended my first class on Fundamentals of Research today at Madison College. We learned about basic research methods, research objectives, creating SMART goals, leading and lagging indicators, Voice of Customer (VOC), and Critical to Quality (CTQ). We are to pick a data centered project to research and present via Powerpoint, for the last class.
