Came back from my meditation retreat to finish up my data certificate program - a couple days in a row of night classes. I'm finished now. Feels good. I also began reading a highly recommended book called "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs." I guess it gets pretty dense in later chapters, however I've read a couple of reviews where people mentioned reading the first few chapters as helpful study. So that's the plan. Tonight I worked a little from the Python book, regarding using instances as attributes.
