Lessons on Javascript, like the five primitive data types: numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined. Something to note is that "numbers" encompass integers (whole numbers and negative numbers) and floats, unlike in Python where they are not encompassed by such a definition as "numbers".

Also, remember "modulo" (aka "mod") spits out the remainder. Signified by %.

Concatenation works the same as in Python.

To tell JS to put a double quote in a string, use backslash: "she said \"goodbye!\"" = "she said "goodbye!"".

Variable in JS follow this pattern: var yourVariableName = yourValue;

Naming conventions in JS are camel-case.

Learned about built-in methods: alert("pop up message to user"), prompt("lets us get input from a user"), and console.log("prints something to the JS console").
When you want to hold onto the user input from a prompt, store it in a variable: var userName = prompt ("What is your name?");

Another tip: double backslash is how to comment out things you don't want to run. Anything after the backslashes won't run //This won't run.
