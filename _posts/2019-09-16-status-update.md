So I took a little time off - roughly a week. I guess I didn't even realize I needed it. Between finishing my data certificate and nearly finishing the syntax portion of Python Crash Course, I feel like it was a well deserved break. Girlfriend was in town and I turned my focus to a couple of pieces of artwork, now both finished. I also realized that I need to redirect a bit. I've purchased a Udemy course that is centered around web development with Python. I will continue with the book, but I need to focus on application for awhile so that I can get excited. It's important because everthing up to this point, though interesting, has been pretty dry.
