Today I finished up the chapter on functions by learning about storing functions in modules, importing modules, importing specific functions, using 'as' to five a function an alias, using 'as' to give a module an alias, importing all functions in a module, and finally, styling functions according to PEP 8. It feels good to get through this chapter and onto the next: Chapter 9 - Classes.
