Didn't have time for much tonight and not sure how much time I will have tomorrow. I'm going on a meditation retreat starting on Wednesday that will last until Monday. Anyway, tonight I worked a bit on defining attributes and methods for a child class and read through how to override methods from a parent class when working with a child class. Pretty straight-forward. Gonna try and fit in some coding time tomorrow, regardless of how short a time period it may be.
