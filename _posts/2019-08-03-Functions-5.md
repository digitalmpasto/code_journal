Worked on passing lists to a function. Specifically, I worked on modifying a list in a function and preventing a function from modifying a list. I then worked on example problems from the book and spent quite a bit of time going over them. I got a bit hung up now that things are getting more complex and I'm trying to fully understand what's going on. But that's okay. I'm doing my best to make sure I really get this stuff.
