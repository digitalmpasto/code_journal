6:15 - Learned about nesting a row within a row to provide a little bit of spacing. By doing this nesting, you're providing 12 new units within the row to work with.

Learned about assigning order to classes, so that depending on the screen size, they will stack in the order you'd like them to. It's very simple: <div class="col-md-6 order-2 order-md-1"> Make sure to target the other item(s) to instruct their behavior as well. 

Finally, in lesson 111, around the 3:15 mark, we went over creating a nav bar scrolling effect where the fixed nav bar gains a background once you start scrolling downward. This was done using a bit of Javascript, and is a pretty neat effect.
