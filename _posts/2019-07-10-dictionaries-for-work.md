My boss has been having me do some inventory on items at work. It turned out to be a pretty big collection to catalog. I began by recording all of the items manually on paper, and when I finished I needed to come up with an accurate count of the items. Many of the items ended up not being unique, as they were spread out across various work areas. So to get an accurate count, I decided to enter the items into Python dictionaries. I spent this particular night after work creating the dictionaries. Later, when time permits, I will figure out how to get the sum of each item for my count.
