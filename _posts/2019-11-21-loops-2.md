Another example of running a loop, but with characters instead of numbers:

```
//string we're looping over:
var str = "hello";
// first character at index is 0
var count = 0;

while (count < str.length) {
    console.log (str[count]);
    count ++;
}

// "h"
// "e"
// "l"
etc.
```

*Remember that your first character is 0, so the length is always one greater than the highest index of a string.*

*Be careful not to create an infinite loop.*
The below example prints "0" over and over because 'count' is never incremented
```
var count = 0;
while (count < 10) {
    console.log (count);
}
```
**This is not something you ever want to do. It can crash your browser or computer. Although, most browsers today will alert you rather than run it.
If you do run an infinite loop, escape from it as soon as possible.
In most cases CNTRL + C will work.
