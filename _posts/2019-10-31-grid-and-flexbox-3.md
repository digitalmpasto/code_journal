Using "self" in Flexbox is a a great way to control an individual element by overriding a parent element. Let's say, for example, that you have 'align-items-end' within your initial "'row' div class", forcing all of your elements to the end. You can override that by targeting your specific child element's class and adding 'align-self-start', to move that specific element to the start.
