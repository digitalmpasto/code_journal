Worked through the first section on classes today and did the example problems. So this is object oriented programming. I've heard this phrase thrown around a bit and have been curious about it. Very interesting. I got a little hung up (about 30 minutes worth) when I couldn't locate an error, only to realize that I had one extra underscore at the end of my __Init___ method. Ugh. Anyway, today I went over the basics of creating and using a class - making instances, accessing attributes, calling methods, and creating multiple instances. It feels good to be learning about this stuff.
