First learned about prompt, alert, and console.log methods by putting them into practice. Used JS to prompt the user to input their name, store it in a variable, and create an alert to send them a message with their name. Then we wrote a message to the console.

        Code:
        ```
        var userName = prompt("What is your name?");
        alert("Nice to meet you, " + userName);
        console.log("Also great to meet you, " + userName);
        ```

Used knowledge so far to do a couple of exercises, one of them being a simple age calculator where you enter your age and find out how many days you've been alive.
