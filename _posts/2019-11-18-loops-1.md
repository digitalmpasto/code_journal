D.R.Y. - Dont Repeat Yourself. We want our code to be kept as DRY as possible. It saves us a lot of time and it makes our code cleaner.

Loops are a tool to help you dry up your code.

**While Loops**
Repeats code WHILE a condition is true.
Very similar to an If Statement, except it repeats a given code block instead of running it once.

**example**
Print numbers from 1 - 5:

` 
var count = 1;
while (count < 6) {
    console.log("count is: " + count);
    count ++;
}

// count is: 1
// count is: 2
// count is: 3
etc.
`
